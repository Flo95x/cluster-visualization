# Cluster visualization
Visualize different cluster algorithms in a simple streamlit application

Cluster visualization is a [streamlit](https://streamlit.io) app that allows users to identify clusters in their two- or three-dimensional data by selecting a [sklean](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html) cluster algorithm and interactively changing their parameters.
